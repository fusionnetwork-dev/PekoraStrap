PekoraStrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and it'd be impossible for us to slip anything malicious into the downloads without anyone noticing. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only two official sources are this GitHub repository.

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't. PekoraStrap doesn't interact with the Pekora client in the same way that exploits do. [Read more about that here.]
